Project Showcase: Personal Finance Management App

I’m excited to share a recent project I’ve worked on—a personal finance management app designed to help users track their expenses and income effortlessly. This app allows users to manage their financial transactions, categorize expenses, and analyze spending patterns through visually appealing reports and charts.

Key Features:
 • Transaction Tracking: Record and categorize income and expenses with real-time updates.
 • Reports and Analytics: View detailed reports with interactive graphs and charts for in-depth financial analysis.
 • Date-Based Filtering: Filter transactions by day, week, month, or year for precise tracking.
 • Category Management: Easily add and manage custom categories for both income and expenses.
 • Localization: The app is localized for different languages, allowing a personalized experience for users worldwide.

Technologies Used:
 • SwiftUI: For building modern and responsive user interfaces.
 • SwiftData: To manage and store data locally.
 • Charts Framework: To create dynamic and interactive financial graphs.
 • Localization: Implemented multiple languages for a broader user reach.
 • Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture: Ensures clean and scalable code architecture.

This project is a great example of how to manage financial data, create interactive reports, and implement best practices in Swift development.
